# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

Watch tests:

```bash
pnpm hardhat watch test
LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm hardhat watch test # for verbose
```

Compile:

```bash
pnpm hardhat compile
```
